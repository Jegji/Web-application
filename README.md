# Web Application

## Overview

The **Web Application** is a web-based tool for managing 3D printing materials and filaments. It is designed to track inventory, monitor usage, and organize different types of materials used in 3D printing. The backend is built with **Java Spring**, while the frontend leverages **Angular** to deliver an intuitive user experience. 

The application uses a **microservices architecture**, with separate services dedicated to filament management and material management. An **API Gateway** is implemented to efficiently handle communication between these services.

This project was created as part of the course **"Architecture of Web Services"** and remains a work in progress.

## Technologies

- **Java Spring Boot**: Backend services and APIs.  
- **Spring Data JPA**: Database interaction and persistence.  
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separation of concerns for scalability and modularity.  
- **Angular**: Responsive and user-friendly frontend.  
- **HTML & CSS**: For styling and UI design.

## Features

- **Filament Management**: Track filament types, colors, and stock levels.  
- **Material Inventory**: Manage and organize various 3D printing materials with detailed properties.  
- **API Gateway**: Streamlined communication between services for smooth operation.  
- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: A seamless connection between Angular and Spring services.
